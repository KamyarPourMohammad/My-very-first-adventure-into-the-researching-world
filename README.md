Multi-Label Chest X-ray Classification using DenseNet121
This repository contains a deep learning pipeline for the multi-label classification of thoracic diseases using chest X-ray images. The project is built using PyTorch and leverages the DenseNet121 architecture, specifically optimized for medical imaging tasks.📌 Project OverviewThe goal of this project is to automate the detection of 10 different clinical findings from radiologist reports. This is a multi-label classification task, meaning a single image can be associated with multiple pathologies simultaneously.Model: DenseNet121Dataset: CheXpert v1.0 (Small)Framework: PyTorch & TorchXRayVision🧠 Model Architecture & TrainingBackbone: DenseNet121 (pre-trained on ImageNet).Input Size: 224x224 pixels.Optimization: Adam Optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-4.Learning Rate Scheduler: CosineAnnealingLR for stable convergence.Loss Function: Binary Cross Entropy with Logits Loss (BCEWithLogitsLoss), suitable for multi-label tasks.🔍 Explainable AI (XAI) IntegrationThis project is designed with transparency in mind. Because DenseNet121 uses global average pooling before the final classification layer, it is highly compatible with Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping).Feature Map Extraction: The model saves hooks at the last convolutional layer (features) to extract spatial importance maps.Visual Interpretability: Using Grad-CAM, we can generate heatmaps to verify if the model is focusing on relevant anatomical regions (e.g., the lungs or heart) rather than image artifacts.📊 PerformanceThe model is evaluated using the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC) for each individual label to ensure a balanced assessment across all pathologies.MetricResultBest Mean AUC~0.83 (Based on epoch 3)
